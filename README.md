# codecrafter-test

I am learning rust by https://codecrafters.io, and using this project to verify my progress.

This is a hobby project, and I am not affiliated with codecrafters.io.

## Usage

This project is almost wrote with unit tests by go, so you should install go first, [go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Echo project as one test.go file, the order of the test is the same as the course unless codecrafters.io updates the course.

ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢: When you fail on a case which you think your implementation is correct, feel free to skip my test or open a issue. Since this is not the official test tool, some judge conditions may not be different. It's better to pay [the referral](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/fantastic-monkey-146935).
